Final Project: Warehouse Automation using YOLOv8.
# Warehouse Automation Pilot Project: Steel Component Detection and Sizing

1. Project Overview
This project presents a real-time object detection and classification system for steel components (elbows and branches) within a warehouse setting, crucial for automated inventory management and quality control.

The system is developed as the final assignment for the Computer Vision course and leverages the state-of-the-art YOLOv8 model architecture. A critical feature is the two-fold approach:
1. Classification: Identify the Brand, Description (Angle/Type), and Material Grade.
2. Sizing: Estimate the physical size (diameter in mm) of the component using bounding box dimensions.
