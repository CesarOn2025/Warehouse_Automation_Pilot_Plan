# Model Information

This project was trained using **Roboflow 3.0 Object Detection (Fast)**.

Roboflow 3.0 models do **not provide a downloadable `best.pt` file**, so the trained weights cannot be exported as YOLOv8 format.

The model is hosted and executed directly on Roboflow’s cloud inference system.
