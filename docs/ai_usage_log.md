AI Usage Log
This document describes how AI tools (Copilot / ChatGPT) were used during the development of this project.

1. Project Planning
AI was used to:
- Clarify the project requirements based on the ITAI-1378 Final Project Guide.
- Help structure the GitHub repository according to the mandatory format.
- Suggest the recommended folder organization (data, models, notebooks, results, docs).

2. Code Assistance
AI assisted with:
- Writing example Python code for YOLOv8 inference (demo.py).
- Providing template code for training, evaluation, and demo notebooks.
- Explaining how to load datasets from Roboflow and how to export YOLOv8 models.

All code was reviewed, tested, and adapted manually by the student.

3. Documentation
AI helped generate:
- The main README.md structure and text.
- The dataset README inside the `data/` folder.
- This AI Usage Log document.
- Explanations for how to upload files to GitHub and how to organize the project.

4. Presentation Support
AI provided:
- Guidance on what to include in the final PPT.
- Suggestions for structuring the live demo and video demo.

The final PPT content and screenshots were created manually by the student.

5. What Was Done Manually
The following tasks were performed entirely by the student:
- Dataset creation (photos), annotation, and Roboflow setup.
- Model training and evaluation.
- Recording the demo video.
- Creating the final presentation slides.
- Uploading and organizing all project files in GitHub.

6. Summary
AI was used as a support tool for:
- Documentation  
- Code templates  
- Project structure  
- Clarifying instructions  

All core work (dataset, training, results, demo, presentation) was completed by the student.
